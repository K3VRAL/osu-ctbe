# osu-better-experience

osu-better-experience are projects I have made that reads data from osu!.exe (while in game), and modifies the game experience such that I don't have to deal with guessing data, with the lack of information osu!client gives. No malicous intent is made to give an advantage, in the sense of destroying the inital intent of playing the game, information, that may be deemed worthless to others, is given that I would like to have that osu!client does not provide.
